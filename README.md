# SCCU_capstone_S25

## Business problem & project objective

SCCU(Swire Coca-Cola United States) tries to optimize logistics by transitioning customers selling below a specific annual volume to an Alternate Route to Market (ARTM). There is an annual 400 gallons volume threshold used to distinguish the customers between the direct delivery route and ARTM.

However, SCCU is looking for a more cost-efficient strategy to decide new threshold for optimizing logistics which is driving better operational efficiency and more revenues.
