# SCCU_capstone_S25

## Business problem & Project objective

SCCU(Swire Coca-Cola United States) tries to optimize logistics by transitioning customers selling below a specific annual volume to an Alternate Route to Market (ARTM). There is an annual 400 gallons volume threshold used to distinguish the customers between the direct delivery route and ARTM.

However, SCCU is looking for a more cost-efficient strategy to decide new threshold for optimizing logistics which is driving better operational efficiency and more revenues.

## Solution to the business problem

This analysis will focus on building the classification model to predict who is going to be a growth customer segment (those who were below the threshold from 2023 but becoming above the threshold on following year (2024)) based on the 2023 historical data only, and which volume threshold would be more optimal compared to original (400) threshold.

Our analysis will meet to these missions:

- Identifying which customers should be included in ARTM versus DDR.
- Determining the optimal volume threshold to improve logistical efficiency.
